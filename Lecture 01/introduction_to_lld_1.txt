Introduction to lld

Designing the internal structure (“skeleton”) of an application by identifying
classes/objects, their relationships, data flows, and how DSA solutions plug into this
structure.


Three LLD core principle and focus
    -> Scalability
        -> Handle large user volumes easily.
        -> Code structure should allow rapid, low‑effort expansion (adding servers, features).

    -> Maintainability
        -> New features shouldn’t break existing ones.
        -> Code should be easy to debug and locate bugs.

    -> Reusability (Plug and play model) 
        -> Write loosely coupled, “plug‑and‑play” modules (e.g. generic notification or matching
            algorithms usable across apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon delivery).


What is Not LLD

    HLD : High level Design
        Focuses on 
            -> Tech Stack (Java/ SpringBoot)
            -> DB(SQL, NoSql)
            -> Server Scale
            -> Cost optimization 

DSA is the brain of an application and LLD is Skeleton
