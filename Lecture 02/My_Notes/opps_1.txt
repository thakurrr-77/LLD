HISTORY OF PROGRAMMING

    -> Machine language (0/1)
        01011001 01101
            -> prone to error 
            -> Tedious
            -> not scalable
    
    -> Assembly level language
        MOV A, 61H
            -> prone to error
            -> Not scalable
            -> Tedious
    
    -> Procedural Programming
        Function
        Loops 
        Blocks (If else ,switch)

        set of instructions
    
    -> OOPS (Object oriented programming)
        -> Solved real world problem
        -> Data security
        -> are highly scalable 
        -> are reusable 




OOPS 

    Object
        -> Characteristics 
        -> Behaviour

        eg. 
            Car :   
                Characteristics :  engine , Brand , Model 
                Behaviour : Start, Stop , gear change ,accelerate , brake

            Pseudocode 
            Class car {
                String Brand
                string Model
                bool engineOn

                void Start(){}
                void stop(){}
            } 


    Pillars of OOPS
        -> Abstraction
        -> Encapsulation
        -> Inheritance
        -> Polymorphism


    Access Modifiers 

        -> Public 
        -> Private
        -> Protected
